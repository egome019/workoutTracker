  ## Description

  The application is a workout tracker that allows you to view, create, and track daily workouts. You have the option to choose between a cardio workout that allows for time and distance of the exercise to be tracked or a resistance workout that keeps record of the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of the exercise.
